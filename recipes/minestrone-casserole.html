    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly coat a 3-quart baking dish with nonstick cooking
            spray.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add pasta and cook, covered, for the minimum time according to package
            directions. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery; cover and cook,
            stirring occasionally, until carrots are just tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Add zucchini and garlic. Cook and stir
            1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Add carrot mixture, beans, tomatoes, green beans, tomato sauce, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning,
            salt, and pepper to the bowl of pasta. Stir well to combine. Transfer pasta mixture to the prepared dish and
            cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove foil and top with mozzarella cheese; continue baking until
            heated through and cheese is melted,10 to 15 minutes. Top each serving with remaining Parmesan cheese and
            sprinkle with fresh herbs.</li>
